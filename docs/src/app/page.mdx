# Rex - react-exotics

Exotic components, hooks and functions you wouldn't find in most react component libraries. \
Meant to be used as an addition to other big component libraries.

# Getting Started

Install the library with the package manager of your choise.

```sh
npm install @etecture/rex
yarn add @etecture/rex
pnpm add @etecture/rex
```

If you intend to use components you need to add the library styles to your project.

```tsx
import "@etecture/rex/styles.css";
```
