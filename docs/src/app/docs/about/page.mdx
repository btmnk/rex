import { ContentLayout } from "../../../layout/ContentLayout/ContentLayout"

# About REX

With REX we aim to create a collection of complex components, hooks and functions for React that usually don't fit into existing libraries. This library is meant to be used as an addition to your component library of choice and thus we try to design every part as customizable and unopinionated as possible so it can be easily integrated into your application.

export default function MDXPage({ children }) {
  return <ContentLayout>{children}</ContentLayout>;
}
