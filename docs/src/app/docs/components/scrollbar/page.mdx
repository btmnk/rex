import { ComponentLayout } from "../../../../layout/ComponentLayout/ComponentLayout"

The Scrollbar is by default in an "auto" mode. It will try to take as much space as possible from its container.
If its contents cannot fit the available space the scrollbars will be shown.

```tsx
<Scrollbar>
  <div>{longContent}</div>
</Scrollbar>
```

You can also limit the max and min height of the scrollbar container.

```tsx
<Scrollbar mah={600} mih={150}>
  <div>{longContent}</div>
</Scrollbar>
```

With this the container will not get taller than 600px and always keeps at least 150px.

> If you use the Scrollbar in a flex layout set the `mih` prop to 0 so it will not be forced to take more space than the flex parent.

## Styling

To every part of the component a classname can be added.

```tsx
classNames?: {
  root?: string;
  viewport?: string;
  verticalTrack?: string;
  verticalThumb?: string;
  horizontalTrack?: string;
  horizontalThumb?: string;
};
```

Since the default styles of the Scrollbar are layered, you can easily override everything.

export default function MDXPage({ children }) {
  return <ComponentLayout componentName={"Scrollbar"}>{children}</ComponentLayout>;
}
