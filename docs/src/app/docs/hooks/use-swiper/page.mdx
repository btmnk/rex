import { Default } from "@/examples/hooks/useSwiper"

```tsx
// a ref to the scrollable container
const viewportRef = useRef<HTMLDivElement>(null);
useSwiper({ viewportRef });
```

The hook will catch mouse events to simulate a mobile swipe behaviour. When the device already has touch the hook will not do anything to retain the native swipe behaviour.

There are two specific properties to control the momentum after releasing the mouse.

```tsx
useSwiper({ viewportRef, dampenerMultiplier: 0.97, velocityMultiplier: 1 });
```

The `dampenerMultiplier` controls how fast the velocity subsides with each frame, the smaller the number the faster the velocity decreases with each frame.
e.g. `0.96` will reduce the velocity by 4% each frame, `0.50` would reduce it by 50% each frame.

The `velocityMultiplier` on the other hand multiplies the momentum of the scroll when releasing the mouse. `1` would be roughly the speed of movement when the mouse was released.

## Example

<Demo data={Default} />

export default function MDXPage({ children }) {
  return <ComponentLayout componentName={"useSwiper"}>{children}</ComponentLayout>;
}
