# rex - react exotics

Exotic components, hooks and functions that you wouldn't find in the usual react component library. \
The goal is to have a library with very specific features that other big component libraries might not cover.

> ⚠ This library is currently only available as an esm module. Using this in a non-esm project will result in errors. \
> [Explanation & Guide](https://tsmx.net/convert-existing-nodejs-project-from-commonjs-to-esm/#tldr_%E2%80%93_fast-lane_conversion)

> ⚠ This library is in a very early development stage. Expect breaking changes with minor version changes! \
> Once the library hits version 1.0.0 we will make sure to use a conventional [semver](https://semver.org/) approach and always keep minor version changes compatible.
