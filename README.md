# rex - react exotics

Exotic components, hooks and functions that you wouldn't find in the usual react component library. \
The goal is to have a library with very specific features that other big component libraries might not cover.

> âš  This library is in a very early development stage. Expect breaking changes with minor version changes! \
> Once the library hits version 1.0.0 we will make sure to use a conventional [semver](https://semver.org/) approach and always keep minor version changes compatible.
